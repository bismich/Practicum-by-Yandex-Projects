You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
You'll study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

Description of the datatabase with info on taxi rides in Chicago:

neighborhoods table: data on city neighborhoods

•	name: name of the neighborhood

•	neighborhood_id: neighborhood code

cabs table: data on taxis

•	cab_id: vehicle code

•	vehicle_id: the vehicle's technical ID

•	company_name: the company that owns the vehicle

trips table: data on rides

•	trip_id: ride code

•	cab_id: code of the vehicle operating the ride

•	start_ts: date and time of the beginning of the ride (time rounded to the hour)

•	end_ts: date and time of the end of the ride (time rounded to the hour)

•	duration_seconds: ride duration in seconds

•	distance_miles: ride distance in miles

•	pickup_location_id: pickup neighborhood code

•	dropoff_location_id: dropoff neighborhood code

weather_records table: data on weather

•	record_id: weather record code

•	ts: record date and time (time rounded to the hour)

•	temperature: temperature when the record was taken

•	description: brief description of weather conditions, e.g. "light rain" or "scattered clouds"
Table scheme
 
Note: there isn't a direct connection between the tables trips and weather_records in the database. But you can still use JOIN and link them using the time the ride started (trips.start_ts) and the time the weather record was taken (weather_records.ts).

You've already done the first part of the project: you wrote a code to parse the weather data from a website. Now you'll do the second and third parts:

Tasks 1-3: Exploratory data analysis

Tasks 4-6: Test the hypothesis that the duration of rides from the the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays


Step 4. Exploratory data analysis (Python)

In addition to the data you retrieved in the previous tasks, you've been given a second file. You now have these two CSVs:

/datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv. It contains the following data:

company_name: taxi company name

trips_amount: the number of rides for each taxi company on November 15-16, 2017.

/datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv. It contains the following data:

dropoff_location_name: Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended

average_trips: the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017.

For these two datasets you now need to

•	import the files
•	study the data they contain
•	make sure the data types are correct
•	identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs
•	make graphs: taxi companies and number of rides, top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs
•	draw conclusions based on each graph and explain the results

Step 5. Testing hypotheses (Python)

/datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv — the result of the last query. It contains data on rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport. Remember, these are the table's field

Values:

•	start_ts
o	pickup date and time
•	weather_conditions
o	weather conditions at the moment the ride started
•	duration_seconds
o	ride duration in seconds

Test the hypothesis:

"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."
Decide where to set the significance level (alpha) on your own.

Explain:

•	how you formed the null and alternative hypotheses

•	what criterion you used to test the hypotheses and why
